# guess-the-number

A programme which picks a (random) number, which the user has to guess. The user may specify the range in the GUI. 

To make the game slightly challenging, a maximum of 7 and 10 tries are given for ranges from 1 to 100, and from 1 to 1000 respectively - these correspond to the nearest higher power of 2.

To run it in IDLE, you will need to install the SimpleGUICS2Pygame package, at https://simpleguics2pygame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package_init.html
